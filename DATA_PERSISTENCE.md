# Data Persistence Implementation

## Current Status

The RemindBuddy app **already implements data persistence** using SQLite database stored in the device's persistent storage location.

### Database Location
- **Path**: `getDatabasesPath()/remindbuddy.db`
- **Platform**: Android persistent storage (survives app updates)
- **Version**: 7 (current)

### What Persists Across App Reinstalls

**✅ Data that WILL persist** (as long as user doesn't clear app data):
1. **Tasks/Reminders** - All calendar-based tasks and reminders
2. **Notes** - All notes including PIN-locked ones
3. **Daily Reminders** - Recurring daily reminders
4. **My Belongings (Checklists)** - All checklists and their items
5. **My Shifts** - Work schedule and shift roster
6. **Gold Prices** - Historical gold price data
7. **Theme Preference** - Dark/Light mode setting (via SharedPreferences)

**❌ Data that will NOT persist** (if user clears app data or uninstalls):
- All database contents
- Scheduled notifications (need to be rescheduled on app restart)
- SharedPreferences settings

### How It Works

1. **Database Initialization** (`storage_service.dart`):
   - Creates database at persistent location on first run
   - Automatically migrates schema on version upgrades
   - All tables created with proper structure

2. **Automatic Data Loading** (on app start):
   - Each screen loads its data from database in `initState()`
   - Examples:
     - `HomeScreen` → loads tasks for selected date
     - `NotesScreen` → loads all notes
     - `MyShiftsScreen` → loads shift roster and metadata
     - `ChecklistsScreen` → loads all checklists
     - `DailyRemindersScreen` → loads all daily reminders
     - `GoldScreen` → loads gold price history

3. **Notification Rescheduling**:
   - Notifications are NOT stored in database
   - They need to be rescheduled when:
     - App restarts
     - Device reboots
     - App is updated

### Current Implementation

All screens already implement proper data loading:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _loadData(); // Loads from database
}
```

### What Was Fixed Today

1. **Month Statistics** - Fixed parsing of month string for proper database query
2. **Dark Theme** - Implemented proper theme persistence with SharedPreferences
3. **Verified** - All database tables are properly created and data persists

### Testing Data Persistence

To verify data persists:

1. Add some data (tasks, notes, shifts, etc.)
2. Close the app completely (swipe away from recent apps)
3. Reopen the app
4. ✅ All data should still be there

To test across reinstall (data will be lost unless backed up):

1. Add some data
2. Uninstall the app
3. Reinstall the app
4. ❌ Data will be gone (this is expected Android behavior)

### Future Enhancement (Optional)

To persist data across reinstalls, you would need to implement:
- Cloud backup (Firebase, etc.)
- Local backup/restore to external storage
- Android Auto Backup (requires configuration)

Currently, the app follows standard Android app behavior where data is tied to the app installation.
