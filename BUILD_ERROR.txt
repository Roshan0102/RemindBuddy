Changed 14 dependencies!
37 packages have newer versions incompatible with dependency constraints.
Try `flutter pub outdated` for more information.
Warning: Flutter support for your project's Gradle version (8.4.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Gradle version to a version of at least 8.7.0 soon.
Running Gradle task 'bundleRelease'...                          
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's gradle version is typically defined in the gradle wrapper file. By default, this can be found at /home/runner/work/RemindBuddy/RemindBuddy/frontend/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties. 
For more information, see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html.

Warning: Flutter support for your project's Android Gradle Plugin version (Android Gradle Plugin version 8.1.1) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Android Gradle Plugin version to a version of at least Android Gradle Plugin version 8.6.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (/home/runner/work/RemindBuddy/RemindBuddy/frontend/android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version. In this case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (/home/runner/work/RemindBuddy/RemindBuddy/frontend/android/build.gradle) by the following line in the dependencies block of the buildscript: "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".

Warning: Flutter support for your project's Kotlin version (1.9.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Kotlin version to a version of at least 2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (/home/runner/work/RemindBuddy/RemindBuddy/frontend/android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (/home/runner/work/RemindBuddy/RemindBuddy/frontend/android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version property.

Gradle task bundleRelease failed with exit code 1
Failed to build AAB.
Command: flutter build appbundle --release --target-platform=android-arm,android-arm64,android-x64
Reason: Exited with code 1.

💡 Fix Recommendations

• Check that running `flutter build` with the same command-line arguments
completes successfully by running the following command:

flutter build appbundle --release --target-platform=android-arm,android-arm64,android-x64

If the above command fails, then this is likely not a Shorebird issue and
the underlying `flutter build` failure must be resolved for Shorebird to
build a release.

• If `flutter build` completes successfully, please ensure that you are
providing the desired flutter version to the release command via 
the `--flutter-version` option. If you do not specify a `--flutter-version`
Shorebird will default to the latest stable version of Flutter.
We strongly encourage always specifying an explicit Flutter version:

shorebird release <platform> --flutter-version=3.29.0

• If `flutter build` completes successfully and `shorebird release`
fails when using the same flutter version, please file an issue:
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/new


If you aren't sure why this command failed, re-run with the --verbose flag to see more information.

You can also [file an issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/new/choose) if you think this is a bug. Please include the following log file in your report:
